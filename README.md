# Neotron OS

This is the Neotron OS. It will run on any system which can execute ARM Thumb v7-M instructions, and has an implementation of the [Neotron BIOS](https://github.com/neotron-compute/Neotron-BIOS).

## Status

This OS is a work in progress. We intend to support:

* [ ] Text mode console (on both text and bitmap displays)
* [ ] Starting a command-line shell application
* [ ] Executing applications from RAM
* [ ] MBR/FAT32 formatted block devices with standard open/close/read/write file semantics
* [ ] Basic networking
* [ ] Music playback
* [ ] Various keyboard layouts
